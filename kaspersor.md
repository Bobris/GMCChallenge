# Open Source love ...

## First some of the ones that I love and contribute to a lot ;-)

[DataCleaner](https://github.com/datacleaner/DataCleaner): Now a commercial Quadient product, but this is the open source core that it's built on and we've even got ex-colleagues who help maintain it.

[Apache MetaModel](https://github.com/apache/metamodel): The data layer abstraction toolkit that we use a lot in Quadient.

[Quadient Data Services client for Java](https://github.com/quadient/data-services-client-java): A client SDK for Quadient's Data Services. This is actually becoming quite a cool project with lots of nice built-in error handling, throttling prevention and fluent APIs for some of the more complex services. There's also a .NET SDK, but I work more in the Java variant ;-)

## Some of the repos that I monitor and use a lot

[Libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal): This is just an awesome use of AI for something that we really have a use for too. They ingest all of the addresses in OpenStreetMaps and then have built a probablistic parser that can guess what parts of an unstructured text block means what.

[Dedupe IO](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe): An open source deduping engine. Although our own engines are generally better than this, I think there's inspiration for us to find with what these guys are doing.

[Data Visualization (D3js) screencast materials by Curran Kelleher](https://github.com/curran/screencasts): I followed this screencast series quite recently and lowed all his examples and very good teaching.
