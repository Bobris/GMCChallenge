What I like most
----------------------

### [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
Because you can more think just on back end, when your front end is done :-)

### [gimp](https://github.com/GNOME/gimp)
For me much faster than Photoshop with all needed features

### [Nette](https://github.com/nette/nette)
Because our Barcamp homepage is running on Nette and it is fast to develop with it.

### [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
For me most important JS framework at this moment

### [xbmc](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc)
Running on my Raspeberry Pi, it is best choice

### [java-design-patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns)
Because of life is learning and I like working with Java
