#What I like and thus starred on GitHub

* [**pornel/pngquant**](https://github.com/pornel/pngquant) - Optimizing size of data and especially PNG is my passion. I even created my own set of wrappers. pngquant does it by converting RGB images to indexed.
* [**waleedasif322/TesseraGrid**](https://github.com/waleedasif322/TesseraGrid) - [I tessellate photos.](http://www.mozaikar.cz) All algorithms in this field are interesting for me.
* [**vim-scripts/esperanto**](https://github.com/vim-scripts/esperanto) - As I like the purpose of esperanto and the language itself, this can be a good tool for writing seamlessly in it. I may give it a try one day...
* [**Predelnik/DSpellCheck**](https://github.com/Predelnik/DSpellCheck) - I use Notepad++ every day. And DSpellCheck is a great spell checker for it. The best feature for me is a support for multiple languages - simultaneously.
* [**fogleman/AllRGB**](https://github.com/fogleman/AllRGB) - My passion for PNG also led to [my contribution to allRGB](http://allrgb.com/petr.diblik). This tool for converting images to allRGB is simply cool!
* [**FortAwesome/Font-Awesome**](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/) - I was searching in [Unicode character table](http://unicode-table.com) for an "external link" char. And I found much more in Font Awesome.
